Preparing to take the SAFe 5 Agile exam and become a certified SAFe® Agilist (SA).

> A SAFe Agilist (SA) strategically guides the adoption, success, and ongoing improvement of Lean- Agile culture in an enterprise. The Agilist helps define the organizational mission and vision, and communicates strategic decisions and the need for change to all stakeholders and teams. The Agilist motivates knowledge workers by helping them develop their skills and careers in a way that enhances their capabilities and increases their engagement and commitment to the mission and vision of the enterprise.

> "Those who master large-scale software delivery will define the economic landscape of the 21st century." - Mik Kersten, Project to Product

We are just now moving from into the deployment period of the age of software.

Chart of the 7 core competencies of the lean enterprise:

![core-pracrices](https://i.imgur.com/atrXanq.png)

1.  Team and Technical Agility
    1.  Teams follow scrum patterns and meetings but replace terms
    2.  Team of agile teams: Agile Release Train (ART)
    3.  50 - 125 people
    4.  ART runs within a Program Increment (PI) and is 5 iterations long
    5.  There is a PI planning event. ART roles:
        1.  "Scrum Master" for the ART is called the Release Train Engineer
        2.  Product Management handles the backlog
        3.  System Architect
        4.  A program board is used to visualize dependencies between the teams

Multiple levels of application. Don't need the whole thing. It's modular. (An adaptation/conversion of this in DAO format should be the same)

1.  4 Core Values
    1.  alignment
    2.  built-in quality
    3.  transparency
    4.  program execution
2.  7 core competencies with 3 dimensions per competency
    1.  Team and Technical Agility
    2.  Agile product delivery
    3.  Enterprise solution delivery
    4.  Lean portfolio management
    5.  Organizational Agility
    6.  Continuous Learning Culture
    7.  Lean-Agile Leadership
3.  The 10 SAFe LEan-Agile Principles
    1.  Take an economic view
    2.  Apply systems thinking
    3.  Assume variability; preserve options
    4.  Build incrementally with fast; integrated learning cycles
    5.  Base milestones on objective evaluation of working systems
    6.  Visualize and limit WIP, reduce batch sizes, and manage queue lengths
    7.  Apply cadence, synchronize with cross-domain planning
    8.  Unlock the intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers
    9.  Decentralize decision-making
    10.  Organize around value
4.  Agile Manifesto (4 values)
    1.  Individuals and interactions over processes and tools 
    2.  Working software over comprehensive documentation 
    3.  Customer collaboration over contract negotiation 
    4.  Responding to change over following a plan
5.  Agile Manifesto Principles
    1.  Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
    2.  Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
    3.  Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for the shorter timescale.
    4.  Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
    5.  Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
    6.  The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
    7.  Working software is the primary measure of progress.
    8.  Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
    9.  Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
    10.  Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
    11.  The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
    12.  At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

> Scrum is built on transparency, inspection, adaptation, and short learning cycles.
